Nothing interesting to see in this repo, just files for the mostly empty website/blog I'll be utilizing someday.

~~Eventually there'll be a custom domain & etc, give it time.~~  
UPDATE: Gave it time, there is now a custom domain "& etc."  
Granted, I haven't had enough time to put *any* useful content on here but I'll add to it when I can.
