# Personally Curated Merc Builds
## Designed for R3 through R7+, maxes at ~R18
#### Each build is labelled with a recommended min R

### Lightning Forge [Neutral] [R7+ ~ R14]
#### Intro
From RGWikia *"Merc Builds"*
"Simple rush build that avoids the common annoyances of RNG and the setup required for grand balance builds, and has relatively fast setup even without excavs. Best for the lower Rs after getting bloodlines. Something of a compromise between Diamond Forge and Elven Farms. Note the synergy between Elfline, Dwarvern Pickaxe, and the Gold upgrade choices of Battlehammers and Elven Diplomacy."
#### Instructions
Save mana and do one or two full combos, can do more but two is plenty for a rush.
